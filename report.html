      <li>This app is designed to allow a user to search for a country and get information about some of the cities
        in that country. When the user searches for a country, the program sends a request to GeoDB, a geography api, which gathers
        the top 5 most populus cities in that country. It then displays those cities as list items that are also buttons to the user.
        The user can then click on any of the cities to send a request to WeatherAPI, which will gather current weather data about that city
        and display it. The user can search for as many countries as they wish and the program will add the five most populus cities of each
        country searched to the list. The user can filter results by population, city name, and country name.
